# STATE.md — StageCraft 3D: Concert & Event Designer

Single source of truth for project status. Updated after every completed task.

Engine: UE 5.8 · Module: `ModularSceneBuilder` (Runtime) · Roadmap: 5 phases (Data core → Interfaces/Base actor → Controller & spawning → Gizmo → UI & color picker).

## #1 — Phase 1: Data-Driven Core (2026-09-29)

**What & why**
Built the data layer so props, stage elements and lights are pure content. You add or remove items by creating or deleting data assets, with no C++ changes.

- `UBaseItemData` (`UPrimaryDataAsset`) is the catalog entry. It holds DisplayName, Description, Icon, CategoryTag (GameplayTag under `StageCraft.Category`), ItemType (`Prop` / `StageElement` / `Light`), ActorClass (soft class to spawn), an optional Mesh override, and `FStageItemPlacementRules` (Single vs Continuous placement, grid size, offset, align-to-normal). Phase 3's spawn system reads these rules.
  - Every heavy reference is soft and tagged with an asset bundle. The catalog loads only `"UI"` (icons). Selecting an item streams its `"Game"` bundle (mesh and class).
  - `GetPrimaryAssetId()` returns type `StageItem`, so the Asset Manager discovers every asset under `/Game/StageCraft/Items` (config in `DefaultGame.ini`).
  - Editor data validation: a missing ActorClass is an error. An empty DisplayName, a missing CategoryTag, or a Light set to Continuous placement is a warning. Changing ItemType to Light sets placement to Single automatically.
- `EStageItemType` is an enum because systems branch on it (for example, lights get the color picker). Open-ended grouping uses GameplayTags, so designers add categories in Project Settings without code. Native tags live in `StageCraftTags::` (Stage, Truss, Audio, Screen, Lighting, Prop).
- `UStageItemSubsystem` (`UGameInstanceSubsystem`) owns the catalog and the current selection.
  - After the asset registry's initial scan, it async-loads all StageItem assets with the UI bundle, sorts them by name, and fires `OnCatalogLoaded`.
  - `SelectItem()` streams the Game bundle first and fires `OnSelectedItemChanged(New, Previous)` only when the item is ready to spawn. A newer request overrides one that is still loading.
  - It has no polling and no actor iteration. Consumers bind to the delegates.
  - It is a subsystem rather than a `UGameInstance` subclass, so it works with any GameInstance and keeps a single responsibility.
- Added a `LogStageCraft` log category and moved module sources into `Public/` and `Private/`.

**Files changed**
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/ModularSceneBuilder.Build.cs`: added the `GameplayTags` dependency
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/ModularSceneBuilder.h` (moved from module root): LogStageCraft declaration
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Private/ModularSceneBuilder.cpp` (moved from module root): LogStageCraft definition
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Data/StageItemTypes.h`, `Private/Data/StageItemTypes.cpp`: new
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Data/BaseItemData.h`, `Private/Data/BaseItemData.cpp`: new
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Subsystems/StageItemSubsystem.h`, `Private/Subsystems/StageItemSubsystem.cpp`: new
- `Config/DefaultGame.ini`: added the `StageItem` entry to `PrimaryAssetTypesToScan`
- `Content/StageCraft/Items/`: folder created, empty (git does not track empty folders)

**Verification**
- Compiled clean with `Build.bat ModularSceneBuilderEditor Win64 Development` on UE 5.8 (0 errors, 0 warnings). Done by Claude.
- Runtime behavior is implemented and awaiting manual verification. To test: create one or two `BaseItemData` assets in `/Game/StageCraft/Items`, run PIE, and check the Output Log for `Stage item catalog loaded: N items.`

**Commit:** uncommitted (working tree)

**Known issues / follow-ups**
- `ActorClass` is `TSoftClassPtr<AActor>`. Narrow it to `AModularBaseActor` in Phase 2.
- Game-bundle assets stay loaded after you switch selection. This is intentional: placed actors hard-reference them anyway. Revisit if the catalog grows large.
- No Obsidian session log was written: the vault path `S:\OBSIDIAN VAULTS\...` was not accessible from this machine.

## #2 — Phase 2: Interaction interface & base actor (2026-09-29)

**What & why**
Added the interaction contract and the parent class for every placed stage item. Input code (Phase 3) and the gizmo (Phase 4) will talk only to the interface and delegates, never to concrete actor types.

- `IInteractableInterface` (`UInteractableInterface`): `OnHoverBegin`, `OnHoverEnd`, `OnSelect`, `OnDeselect`, `GetInteractionDetails`.
  - All are BlueprintNativeEvents, so Blueprint-only actors can implement them. C++ callers use `IInteractableInterface::Execute_*`.
  - Implementations must be idempotent.
  - `GetInteractionDetails` returns `FStageItemInteractionDetails` (ItemData, DisplayName, ItemType, `bSupportsColorEditing`, Color). The Phase 5 color picker reads it; light subclasses opt in.
- `AModularBaseActor` (AActor + IInteractableInterface):
  - **Component:** a `UStaticMeshComponent` root. It is Movable, uses BlockAllDynamic as QueryOnly (traceable, no physics), and has overlap events off.
  - **Item data:** a `TObjectPtr<UBaseItemData> ItemData` link, exposed on spawn and editable on level-placed instances.
  - **Initialization:** `virtual InitializeFromItemData(UBaseItemData*)` stores the data, calls `virtual ApplyItemData()` (mesh plus per-slot material overrides, only when the data supplies a Mesh, so Blueprint-authored visuals stay untouched), then fires the Blueprint event `BP_OnItemDataApplied`. `OnConstruction` re-applies the data for editor-placed instances.
  - **Highlight:** hover and selection feedback use `SetOverlayMaterial` with `HoverOverlayMaterial` / `SelectedOverlayMaterial` (set in class defaults). It updates only when state changes; the actor has no tick.
  - **Selection event:** the `OnSelectionChanged(Actor, bSelected)` delegate fires on select and deselect. It also fires with `false` from `EndPlay` when a selected actor is destroyed, so the gizmo and details panel release it without polling.
- `UBaseItemData` changes (follow-up from #1):
  - `ActorClass` is now `TSoftClassPtr<AModularBaseActor>` and defaults to `AModularBaseActor`, so simple props need no Blueprint.
  - Added `MaterialOverrides` (soft, in the Game bundle).
  - New validation error: the plain base actor with no Mesh would spawn invisible.

**Files changed**
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Interaction/InteractableInterface.h`: new (header-only)
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Actors/ModularBaseActor.h`, `Private/Actors/ModularBaseActor.cpp`: new
- `Source/ModularSceneBuilder/Public/Data/BaseItemData.h`, `Private/Data/BaseItemData.cpp`: ActorClass type and default, MaterialOverrides, validation

**Verification**
- Compiled clean with `Build.bat ModularSceneBuilderEditor Win64 Development` on UE 5.8 (0 errors, 0 warnings). Done by Claude.
- Runtime behavior is implemented and awaiting manual verification. To test: create a `BaseItemData` with a Mesh, drop an `AModularBaseActor` into a level, and set its ItemData. The mesh should appear. Assign overlay materials in a Blueprint subclass and call `OnHoverBegin` / `OnSelect` from a test Blueprint to check the highlight.

**Commit:** uncommitted (working tree, on top of the uncommitted #1)

**Known issues / follow-ups**
- No overlay materials ship yet. The highlight shows nothing until `HoverOverlayMaterial` / `SelectedOverlayMaterial` are set (for example in a `BP_ModularBaseActor` defaults class). This is a content task.
- Phase 3 should add a dedicated trace channel (for example `StageItem`) so cursor traces don't depend on BlockAllDynamic/Visibility.
